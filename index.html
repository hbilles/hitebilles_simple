          As a software engineer based in New York, I'm a spatial, visual &amp; logical thinker
          who enjoys working with complex systems. My focus has been primarily working with front-end
          technologies, but I also do software system design. Aside from that I've also worked in
          multiple sectors including architecture and urban design.
